Welcome to my homepage! I am a second-year Ph.D. student co-advised by Dr. [Mathieu Bauchy](http://mathieu.bauchy.com/) and Dr. [Puneet Gupta](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/puneet-gupta/). My research interests include data-driven material analysis and machine/deep learning applications in material science.    

A quality-oriented student with the ability to apply machine learning in an industrial setting. Skilled in machine learning libraries, like JAX, TensorFlow and PyTorch and software development with Java, Python, and C/C++. Have hands-on experience with developing optimization and ML algorithms and running experiments on material systems. Have enthusiasm towards learning new skills.          

I was born in Tianjin, China and then moved to Bay Area, California with my family in 2012. After completing my school at De Anza College, I transferred to UCLA majoring in Computer Science. I got my B.S. Degree in June 2019 and then went directly to my current Ph.D. program. Right now, I am living with my perfect wife, Lia, in Glendale, California. 

Besides doing research and coding, I also love sports, traveling and food.
