Welcome to my homepage! I received my Ph.D. from UCLA and start working at Meta as a Research Scientist in 2025. My research interests include data-driven material analysis and applied machine/deep learning in material science.          

I was born in Tianjin, China and migrated with my family to the Bay Area, California in 2012. After graduating from De Anza College, I moved to UCLA where I got both my B.S. and Ph.D. I am currently residing in Cupertino, California, with my perfect wife, Lia.

Besides doing research and coding, I also love sports, traveling and food.
