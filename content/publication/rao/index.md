abstract: "Despite the ubiquity of porous materials, their mechanical behaviors (e.g., fracture) remain only partially understood. Here, we propose a novel analytical stochastic micromechanical damage model to describe the fracture of porous materials subjected to uniaxial tension. This analytical model relies on parallel elastic and plastic elements to describe the nonlinear stressâ€“strain curve of porous phases. We then develop a stochastic damage model to describe the propagation of randomly scattered voids or microflaws. This model allows us to identify the key influential features that govern the failure of porous materials. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of our model by validating its outcomes by a series of peridynamic simulations."
