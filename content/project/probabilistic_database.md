* Built parser that parses a fully quantified union of conjunctive queries (UCQ) to a certain data structure
* Implemented the lifted inference algorithm to lift the input query
* Created a mini compiler that evaluates the lifted query and translates it to a SQL query which accesses a backend rational SQL database
* Made possible for users to formulate complex queries and for the system to apply complex optimizations
